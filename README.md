# Final_Project
What kind of system are we building? 

LOGIN SYSTEM

The vast majority of Login System have decided to do so because of our thoughts about.
how to make a login system that works every time we go to different website, such as Facebook, Email and so on. 

HOW DID WE MAKE THE LOGIN SYSTEM?

 First, we create a new folder in java class and we put the package name and public class Login Extend and other requirements into the program.
 
 While we encod, we also create a chart for our system.
 
 We create a layout for Login design.
 
 After thingking about the layout, we started to solidify it.
 
 We chose shapes for Login button.
 
 The fist thing we put in was the USERNAME and then the PASSWORD, and then the LOGIN button.
 
 Fourth, for that system to work it must first place the Username "Admin" and then the Password "1234".
 
 And applied to the action performed 
 
 Lastly, we successfully fineshed the coding and tried to turn the outcome into a successful one.
